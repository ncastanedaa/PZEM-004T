This repository shows two codes for reading and setting up pzem 004t energy meter using python. 
the first code pzem.py reads the values in the registers acording to datasheet
the second code set_address_pzem.py sets the modbus addres of the device. this is useful if you want to measure two ore more circuits using several sensors in a signle modbus channel
